## Problem 1 

Let's import the dataset and load the package

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(moderndive)

data("early_january_weather")
```


The dataset 'early_january_weather' contains 15 variables of weather data collected at EWR. 

Important variables include:

* 'temp': the temperature in F.

* 'wind_dir': direction of the wind in degrees

* 'wind_speed': speed of the wind in mph

* 'wind_gust': gust speed of wind in mph

* 'precip': the precipitation in inches

* 'time_hour': the date and hour of the recording

The dataset has `r ncol(early_january_weather)` columns and and `r nrow(early_january_weather)` rows.

The mean temperature is `r mean(early_january_weather$temp)`.

```{r}
ggplot(early_january_weather, aes(x = time_hour, y = temp))
```
